Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
What are the most optimal skills to learn?
